# game
A very accurate game based in the year 9,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 written in C. There isn't any movement or anything. It's pretty boring, and if you play, you get why.
## Installation I think
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/DamieFC/game.git
$ cd game
$ make
$ sudo make install
```
I don't know how to run from there. Another idea:
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/DamieFC/game.git
$ cd game
$ gcc game.c -o game
