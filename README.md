# Dumbgame
A very accurate game based in the year 9,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 written in C. There isn't any movement or anything. It's pretty boring, and if you play, you get why.
## Installation I think
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/DamieFC/Dumbgame.git
$ cd Dumbgame
$ make
$ sudo make install
```
I don't know how to run from there. Another idea:
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/DamieFC/Dumbgame.git
$ cd Dumbgame
$ gcc game.c -o game # or whatever you want to call it
```
I think that one's the best. Ok then:
## Recommended Installation
### What you will need:
1. `GCC`
2. `git`
### What to do:
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/DamieFC/Dumbgame.git
$ cd Dumbgame
$ gcc game.c -o game
```
## Uninstallation
I don't think that's even a word, but you're gonna want to uninstall. Here's how:
```shell
$ rm game # or whatever you called it
```
There. Nothing on me now!
